### **I am building with Livepeer Studio at a hackathon. Is there a cost to stream?**

In the hundreds of hackathon projects that were built using Livepeer Studio,
none have ever exceeded the alloted free minutes provided in the Hacker plan. If
this is a concern, email Livepeer Inc at
[help@livepeer.org](mailto:help@livepeer.org) or reach out
on [Discord](https://discord.gg/livepeer).

### **Do I need to provide a credit card number to create an account?**

A credit card is not required to create an account.

### **What happens if I exceed the allotted minutes for the Hacker plan?**

If you exceed the allotted minutes for storage, transcode, or delivery usage on
a Hacker account, you will be responsible for paying the overage according to
our pay-as-you go unit pricing. At the end of the billing cycle when you exceed
the Hacker plan limits, you will receive an email indicating that you must enter
payment information within 3 days. If your invoice is not paid and we have not
heard from you by the end of that period, your account will be suspended and you
can reach out to support@livepeer.org to start the reactivation process.

### **What currencies does Livepeer Studio accept?**

USD is the only currency accepted right now via the Livepeer Studio dashboard.
Crypto-native payments are coming later this year. If you prefer to pay with
cryptocurrency now, you may reach out
at [help@livepeer.org](mailto:help@livepeer.org)

### **How are transcoding, storage, and delivery minutes derived?**

For transcode and storage, Livepeer Studio uses the duration of the source
asset, and for delivery, we estimate the minutes viewed based on the average
bitrate and the total amount of data used.

If you have further questions about these calculations or feel that they do not
accurately reflect the characteristics of your project's usage, you may reach
