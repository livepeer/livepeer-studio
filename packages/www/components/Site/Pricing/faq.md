compares to other video infrastructure providers.

### **I am building with Livepeer Studio at a hackathon. Is there a cost to stream?**

In the hundreds of hackathon projects that were built using Livepeer Studio,
none have ever exceeded the alloted free minutes provided in the Hacker plan. If
this is a concern, email Livepeer Inc at
[help@livepeer.org](mailto:help@livepeer.org) or reach out
on [Discord](https://discord.gg/livepeer).

### **Do I need to provide a credit card number to create an account?**

A credit card is not required to create an account.

### **Are there usage limits for the Hacker plan?**

Yes.

There are monthly caps for storage (1,000 minutes), transcode (1,000 minutes), and delivery (10,000 minutes) usage; after these limits are reached in any month, you will not be able to ingest or deliver any additional video until you select a plan. Please note that transcode and delivery usage is calculated on a monthly basis, but storage carries over from month to month unless you explicitly delete stored assets (i.e., if you store 500 minutes of video in one month, you will start the next month with 500 minutes already stored). 

Hacker tier users will receive email notifications at 75%, 90%, and 100% of usage.

Additionally, Hacker plans are limited to 30 concurrent viewers per stream. This is a hard cap and cannot be exceeded.


### **What happens if I exceed the allotted minutes for the Hacker plan?**

If you exceed the allotted minutes for storage, transcode, or delivery usage on
a Hacker account, your account will be disabled until you select a paid plan.

### **What currencies does Livepeer Studio accept?**

USD is the only currency accepted right now via the Livepeer Studio dashboard.
Crypto-native payments are coming later this year. If you prefer to pay with
cryptocurrency now, you may reach out
at [help@livepeer.org](mailto:help@livepeer.org)

### **How are transcoding, storage, and delivery minutes derived?**

For transcode and storage, Livepeer Studio uses the duration of the source
asset, and for delivery, we estimate the minutes viewed based on the average
bitrate and the total amount of data used.

If you have further questions about these calculations or feel that they do not
accurately reflect the characteristics of your project's usage, you may reach
