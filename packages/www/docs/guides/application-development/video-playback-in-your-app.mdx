# Selecting a video player for your app

Livepeer Studio works with any video player that supports HLS live streams.

Other considerations are if the player provides analytics out of the box and if
you can easily style the player.

Some open source players enjoyed by current Livepeer Studio users are
[Video.js](https://videojs.com/) and
[Shaka Player](https://opensource.google/projects/shaka-player).

Livepeer Studio users have also successfully used video players like
[JWPlayer](https://www.jwplayer.com/) or
[TheoPlayer](https://www.theoplayer.com/).
