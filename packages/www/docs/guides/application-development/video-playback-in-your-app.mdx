# Selecting a video player for your app

Livepeer.com works with any video player that supports HLS live streams.

Other considerations are if the player provides analytics out of the box and if
you can easily style the player.

Some open source players enjoyed by current Livepeer.com users are
[Video.js](https://videojs.com/) and
[Shaka Player](https://opensource.google/projects/shaka-player).

Livepeer.com users have also successfully used video players like
[JWPlayer](https://www.jwplayer.com/) or
[TheoPlayer](https://www.theoplayer.com/).
