# Live streaming from your app

Livepeer Studio global-optimized ingest URL is
`rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.studio/live/`.

There are many 3rd party applications that allow streamers to push video in the
RTMP protocol. These include:

- For desktop: [OBS](https://obsproject.com/), [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/),
  [Streamlabs OBS](https://streamlabs.com/)
- For iOS: [Larix](https://softvelum.com/larix/),
  [Streamlabs](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/streamlabs-live-streaming-app/id1294578643)
- For Android:
  [Streamlabs](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.streamlabs&hl=en_US&gl=US)

For building your own streaming application you can also use any RTMP library
available out there. For example, [Streamaxia](https://www.streamaxia.com/) is
available both for iOS and Android.

Livepeer Studio is currently working on additional recommendations for mobile
SDKs. Fill out a [contact form](https://livepeer.studio/contact) if you have
more urgent needs.

## Browser streaming

Streaming from the browser is non-trivial since the RTMP protocol has a
dedicated wire protocol on top of TCP. Browsers do not allow applications to use
TCP directly, so you can't do RTMP directly from a web app.

To make things a little easier, Livepeer provides the
[@livepeer/webrtmp-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@livepeer/webrtmp-sdk)
which can be used for streaming from the browser. It doesn't use RTMP but a
wrapped version of it on top of WebSockets.

Check the package documentation on NPM to get started, it also contains a couple
sample projects that you can get started with. To see a production application
with it check out [justcast.it](https://justcast.it/).

### Codecs

Livepeer hosts its own WebSocket to RTMP server, which the SDK uses by default.
Not all browsers support the video codec
[supported by the Livepeer network](https://livepeer.studio/docs/guides/start-live-streaming/support-matrix)
though, currently only H.264. So this default hosted server will only work well
in Chrome Desktop for now.

If you want to take your browser-streaming application to production and support
users in non-Chrome or non-desktop browsers, you can deploy your own
[webrtmp-server](https://github.com/livepeer/webrtmp-server). All you need to
set is the `LP_STRICT_PROTOCOL=false` flag so it does transcoding of the video
in case the user browser does not support H.264. For an example of such setup
check the
[justcast.it deployment spec on fly.io](https://github.com/victorges/justcast.it/blob/9aab5648d876be13db5330c2d4806ac025281349/webrtmp/fly.toml#L17).

Keep in mind that this transcoding can get unperformant or expensive if you have
a lot of users sending video not in H.264.
