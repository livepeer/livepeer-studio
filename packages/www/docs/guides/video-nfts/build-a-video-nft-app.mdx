# Build a Video NFT app

Livepeer provides a
[helpful JavaScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@livepeer/video-nft) for
building Video NFT apps. You can use it from any part of your application stack,
like your backend and/or your frontend. It includes utilities for:

- Opening a file from your users device and uploading it to the Livepeer API;
- Interacting with the Livepeer VOD API, including requesting an upload URL,
  transcoding the video for an optimized NFT and exporting it to IPFS;
- Minting the actual NFT on an Ethereum/EVM-compatible blockchain.

You can find the SDK on npm as
[@livepeer/video-nft](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@livepeer/video-nft) and its
detailed documentation on [GitHub pages](https://livepeer.github.io/video-nft/).

When building applications with the SDK, you might also find it useful to learn
and make use of
[CORS-enabled API keys](https://livepeer.com/docs/guides/start-live-streaming/api-key#cors),
in case you want to get started without a backend to talk with the Livepeer API.

## Usage Examples

### CLI

The first application to use the SDK was the Video NFT CLI provided by the same
`npm` package. Although it shares the project with the SDK, it is just a regular
user of it like any other application. You can learn more how to use it in our
[Mint a Video NFT](https://livepeer.com/docs/guides/video-nfts/mint-a-video-nft)
guide, and check
[its source code on GitHub](https://github.com/livepeer/video-nft/blob/fc10dbc5b758c864b26e81f7e031268eb174f01c/src/cli/index.ts#L10).

### Mint NFT page

Livepeer also provides the [Mint NFT page](https://livepeer.com/mint-nft) which
uses this SDK. It complements the CLI in the sense of connecting to MetaMask to
mint the file uploaded by the CLI, but it can also be used standalone by
uploading the file directly on the UI as wel.

The source code is inside the code for our dashboard. It is built in React with
next.js and you can check
[the code for the page on GitHub](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-com/blob/898974c72c81b954113d51509b7d09c737e1ea95/packages/www/pages/mint-nft/index.tsx#L102)
as well.

### Sample App

We are also building a specific sample app using the NFT SDK. Its source code
can also be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/codentell/video-nft-sample) and
it is currently being hosted on [Vercel](https://video-nft-sample.vercel.app).
