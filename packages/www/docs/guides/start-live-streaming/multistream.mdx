# Overview

The Multistream API allows a source stream and transcoded renditions to be
pushed to multiple RTMP(S) or SRT targets, such as Facebook Live, Twitch, and
Youtube Live.

# Managing Multistream targets in the Livepeer.com Dashboard

To add, manage, and delete `Multistream Targets`, navigate to the Streams page
([livepeer.com/dashboard/streams](https://livepeer.com/dashboard/streams)) and
click on a stream name. On the stream detail page, on the `Overview` tab, you
can view all configured targets. You must configure new `Multistream Targets`
for each stream. This will apply the multistream configuration to that stream.
`Multistream Targets` do not carry over when you create new streams.

To add a new target, select `Create` on the right side of the
`Multistream Targets` section. You'll be asked to name your target, provide the
Ingest URL and a stream key, being Ingest URL the only required value. The
Ingest URL and stream key should be provided by the platform that you're
streaming into and can be of the RTMP, RTMPS or SRT protocols. Select the
rendition profile that you'd like to send to that target and click
`Create Target`. Once created, you can toggle the targets on and off.

To edit a `Mulitstream Target`, click on the three dots to the right of the
target name and then on `Edit` to open up the target settings. Select
`Update target` when you've completed your changes.

To delete a multistream target, click on the three dots to the right of the
target name and then on `Delete`.

# Managing Multistream targets with the Livepeer.com API

## Multistream Target Object `/multistream/target`

You can also manage `Multistream Target` objects from the API. Each target
represents a specific endpoint where a stream could be multistreamed to. More
details in the [API reference](/docs/api-reference/multistream-target/overview).

<!-- Add notice about how other platforms call this? Re-stream, simulcast, etc -->

Notice that the existence of a `Multistream Target` object itself is not enough
for the multistream to happen. You also need to reference the target from the
`Stream` object that should be multistreamed. To avoid managing the separate
`Multistream Target` objects, you can also create the targets inlined in the
`Stream` creation and update APIs. Check the
[Stream Object](#stream-object-stream) section for more information.

### Create

##### Request: [`POST /api/multistream/target`](/docs/api-reference/multistream-target/create-target)

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://livepeer.com/api/multistream/target' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d '{
    "name": "Eli\'s Twitch",
    "url": "rtmp://rtmp.twitch.tv/live/SECRET"
}'
```

_Supported Protocols: RTMP, RTMPS and SRT._

##### Response

```json
{
  "id": "{id}",
  "userId": "USER123",
  "name": "Eli's Twitch",
  "url": "rtmp://rtmp.twitch.tv/live/SECRET"
}
```

### Read

You can fetch a specific `Multistream Target` with their ID, returned on the
creation request. The destination url will not be returned since it contains
sensitive user data. This way the application developer doesn't have to worry
about storing and securing their users' stream keys.

##### Request: [`GET /api/multistream/target/{id}`](/docs/api-reference/multistream-target/get-target)

```bash
curl 'https://livepeer.com/api/multistream/target/{id}' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}'
```

##### Response

```json
{
  "id": "{id}",
  "userId": "USER123",
  "name": "Eli's Twitch"
}
```

You can also list all existing `Multistream Targets` in the account by omitting
the `{id}` segment in the above request.

##### List Request: [`GET /api/multistream/target`](/docs/api-reference/multistream-target/list-targets)

```bash
curl 'https://livepeer.com/api/multistream/target' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}'
```

The response is an array of `Multistream Target` objects, as returned from the
read API above. The pagination should be done exactly the same as the other
Livepeer.com list APIs.

### Update

You can change an existing target properties at will, and it will affect any
stream that is currently using it. Notice that changes will only take effect
when the next stream session is started.

One of the updateable properties is the `disabled` field. It can be used to
disable multistreaming to a specific target without the need of removing them
from streams nor deleting the target completely.

##### Request: [`PATCH /api/multistream/target/{id}`](/docs/api-reference/multistream-target/update-target)

```bash
curl -X PATCH 'https://livepeer.com/api/multistream/target/{id}' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d '{
    "name": "Not Eli\'s Twitch",
    "url": "rtmp://rtmp.twitter.com/SECRET",
    "disabled": true
}'
```

All request fields are optional. There is no response on a success (HTTP
`204 No Content`).

### Delete

Finally, you can also delete a `Multistream Target` object completely by calling
the delete API. You should not do this if any `Streams` are still referencing
that target or a broken reference will be left. So first update (`PATCH`) any
`Stream` removing the reference to the `Multistream Target` and only then
actually delete it.

##### Request: [`DELETE /api/multistream/target/{id}`](/docs/api-reference/multistream-target/delete-target)

```bash
curl -X DELETE 'https://livepeer.com/api/multistream/target/{id}' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}'
```

There is no response on a success (HTTP `204 No Content`).

## Stream Object: `/stream`

To actually use a `Multistream Target`, you need to reference it from a `Stream`
object.

The reference is made in the `targets` sub-field of the `multistream` field in
the `Stream` resource (`stream.multistream.targets[]`). It is represented as an
array of target reference objects, each with a `profile` that should be
multistreamed and the `id` of the corresponding `Multistream Target`.

The `profile` field must reference an existing transcoding profile on the same
stream, or `"source"` to multistream the same original video as ingested. The
same profile can be mulsitreamed to several `Multistream Targets`, but there can
be only 1 multistream to a given URL.

To avoid managing separate `Multistream Target` objects, you can also create
targets inlined in the `Stream` object on the same mutation request (create or
update). In that case, the target reference object in the `multistream.targets`
field should have a `spec` instead of an `id` with the payload for creating a
new `Multistream Target`. Notice that `spec` is a write-only field, meaning that
`Stream` objects returned from reads (`GET`) will always have only a `profile`
and `id` in the targets. To get the current state of a `Multistream Target`,
fetch from its own read API using that `id`.

### Creating a Stream with Multistream Targets

You can create a `Stream` already with some `Multistream Targets`. Either
reference an existing `Multistream Target` by `id` or create a new
`Multistream Target` inline with the `spec` field. You can also use both types
of targets on the same payload (reference and inline) as long as they are
separate entries in the `multistream.targets` array.

##### By Reference

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://livepeer.com/api/stream' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d '{
    "name": "test_multistream_reference",
    "profiles": [
      { "name": "720p", ... },
      { "name": "480p", ... },
      { "name": "360p", ... }
    ],
    "multistream": {
      "targets":  [
        { "id" :"0bf161f3-95bd-4971-a7b1-4dcb5d39e78a", "profile": "source" },
        { "id" :"95bd0bf1-61f3-a7b1-4971-39e78a4dcb5d", "profile": "720p" }
      ]
    }
}'
```

##### Inline

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://livepeer.com/api/stream' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d '{
    "name": "test_multistream_reference",
    "profiles": [
      { "name": "720p", ... },
      { "name": "480p", ... },
      { "name": "360p", ... }
    ],
    "multistream": {
      "targets": [
        {
          "profile": "720p",
          "spec": {
            "name": "Eli\'s Twitch",
            "url": "rtmp://rtmp.twitch.tv/live/SECRET"
          }
        },
        {
          "profile": "360p",
          "spec": { "url": "rtmp://rtmp.twitter.com/SECRET" }
        }
      ]
    }
}'
```

### Updating Multistream Targets of a Stream

You can also update an existing `Stream` to add or remove `Multistream Targets`.
The schema of all fields is the same as the creation API, with the targets being
referenced with an `id` or created inline with a `spec`. You can also add,
remove or update multiple `Multistream Targets` on the same API call.

Notice that changes to an existing `Stream` will only take effect when the next
stream session is started.

#### Adding Multistream Targets

Since you can combine inlined and referenced `Multistream Targets` on the same
request, it's really easy to add a target by URL to an existing stream:

##### 1. `GET` the current state of the Stream

```bash
curl 'https://livepeer.com/api/stream/{id}' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}'
```

```json
{
  "name": "test_multistream_reference",
  "profiles": [
    { "name": "720p", ... },
    { "name": "480p", ... },
    { "name": "360p", ... }
  ],
   "multistream": {
     "targets":  [
       { "id" :"0bf161f3-95bd-4971-a7b1-4dcb5d39e78a", "profile": "source" },
       { "id" :"95bd0bf1-61f3-a7b1-4971-39e78a4dcb5d", "profile": "720p" }
     ]
   }
}
```

##### 2. `PATCH` the Stream with the new target

```bash
curl -X PATCH 'https://livepeer.com/api/stream/{id}' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d '{
     "multistream": {
        "targets":  [
          { "id" :"0bf161f3-95bd-4971-a7b1-4dcb5d39e78a", "profile": "source" },
          { "id" :"95bd0bf1-61f3-a7b1-4971-39e78a4dcb5d", "profile": "720p" },
          { "profile": "720p", "spec": {"url": "rtmp://rtmp.twitter.com/SECRET"} }
        ]
      }
    }'
```

The `PATCH` can also add new `Multistream Targets` by `id` instead of inline,
just like on `Stream` creation.

#### Removing Multistream Targets

To remove a `Multistream Target` from a `Stream`, you can use the same `PATCH`
request as above to either remove or completely clear the `multistream.targets`
array.

After removing the reference from the `Stream`, you can also delete the
`Multistream Target` object completetly by calling the separate
[Delete `Multistream Target` API](/docs/api-reference/multistream-target/delete-target).
Make sure that no other `Stream` has a reference to that `Multistream Target`
before doing so.

##### Removing a single Multistream Target

To remove a specific target, we need to make a `PATCH` request maintaining only
the targets that we want to keep in the stream, after removing the desired one.

e.g.: Removing only the first target from the example above:

```bash
curl -X PATCH 'https://livepeer.com/api/stream/{id}' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d '{
     "multistream": {
        "targets":  [
          { "id" :"95bd0bf1-61f3-a7b1-4971-39e78a4dcb5d", "profile": "720p" }
        ]
      }
    }'
```

We kept only the remaining targets in the `PATCH`, i.e. the second one.

You can also use a single API call to change the `profile` that should be
multistreamed to a specific target. For that, just change the `profile` field
for the given target when building the `PATCH` request payload.

##### Removing all Multistream Targets

```bash
curl -X PATCH 'https://livepeer.com/api/stream/{id}' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d '{
     "multistream": {
        "targets":  []
      }
    }'
```

# Understanding Multistream Performance

## Dashboard

While a session is active that has multistream targets configured, you'll be
able to see if a destination is "Active" or "Offline". **_NOTE:_** There may be
a slight delay between starting the stream and the push destinations connecting.
When starting to stream to multistream targets, use these indicators to
understand whether it has connected to its target(s).

On the stream page where you've configured your multistream targets, select the
"Health" tab at the top. While a session is active, you'll see the ingest rate
of the source stream.

## API

We have 3 webhooks to help you monitor the state of your `Multistream Targets`::

- `multistream.connected`: When we have successfully connected to the
  `Multistream Target` and you're also online in the other service you are
  multistreaming to.
- `multistream.error`: In case any error has occurred during connection to the
  `Multistream Target`. This means some kind of problem with the configuration
  or the other service you are multistreaming to.
- `multistream.disconnected`: Sent after a stream is ended to indicate that
  Multistream has also ended for the respective target.

For more information on how to use webhooks, please consult our
[Webhooks Documentation](https://livepeer.com/docs/guides/start-live-streaming/webhook).
