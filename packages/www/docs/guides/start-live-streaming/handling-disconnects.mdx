# Handling disconnects

Sometimes, after you’ve connected your encoder (for example, OBS) to and
Livepeer.com RTMP server, the connection drops. For example, this could happen
because of a bug in the encoder software or a problem with the streamer’s
internet connection.

Livepeer.com has a built-in 5 minute reconnect window, which means that if the
streamer’s encoder disconnects and then reconnects within 5 minutes, the session
will resume. If you are using Livepeer.com recording feature, the recorded
session will not be split into two separate sessions.

The reconnect window is currently not customizable.
