# Handling disconnects

Sometimes, after you’ve connected your encoder (for example, OBS) to and RTMP
server, the connection drops. For example, this could happen because of a bug in
the encoder software or a problem with the streamer’s internet connection.

Livepeer Studio has a built-in 5 minute reconnect window, which means that if
the streamer’s encoder disconnects and then reconnects within 5 minutes, the
session will resume. If you are using Livepeer Studio recording feature, the
recorded session will not be split into two separate sessions.

The reconnect window is currently not customizable.
