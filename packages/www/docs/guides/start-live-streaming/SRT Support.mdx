# SRT Support

SRT ingest is supported for all users and is currently in Beta. To stream in SRT, change your stream URL to:

`srt://rtmp.livepeer.com:2935?streamid={stream-key}`

Streaming with SRT is compatible with OBS, but may not be compatible with all encoders. Please ensure that your encoder is compatible with SRT.
