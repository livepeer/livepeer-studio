# Monitoring Stream Health

_Currently, stream health information is only available on the dashboard.
Changes to the API, including subscribing to the events log, will be available
to users soon._

To monitor any active stream for issues that may impact the quality of your
stream, navigate to the Stream Health tab on the stream detail page.

During any Active stream, components on this page will display a variety of
health indicators.

## Global Health Status

- `Healthy` indicates that all of the Health Checks are in a `Healthy` state.
- `Unhealthy` indicates that one or more of the Health Checks are in an
  `Unhealthy` state
- `Idle` indicates that the stream is not currently active

## Health Checks

- **_Transcoding_** — A `Healthy` status indicates that video transcoding is
  occurring and the multiple profiles of your stream are available for playback.
  An `Unhealthy` status indicates that we have failed to generate the profiles
  so only the original video will be available. Check the event log below for
  any actionable errors or check the
  [Status page](https://livepeer.statuspage.io/) for platform-wide issues.
- **_Real-time —_** This indicates whether our system is transcoding the stream
  faster than real time, in other words, if the video transcode latency is lower
  than the video duration. An `Unhealthy` status may be caused by unconventional
  configurations. Check your stream software configuration by following the
  steps
  [in this article,](https://livepeer.com/docs/guides/start-live-streaming/debug-live-stream-issues)
  and restart your stream.
- **_Multistreaming —_** This health check indicates whether all configured
  `Multistream Targets` are connected. If no targets are configured, this will
  show up as blank and not be considered for the global health state. If this
  shows up as `Unhealthy` you can also check the status of the individual
  `Multistream Targets` in the `Overivew` tab, where the targets can be either
  `Idle`, `Pending`, `Online`or `Offline`:

  - An `Idle` status indicates that the stream is not currently active so
    neither is multistreaming.
  - A `Pending` status indicates that our system is trying to connect to the
    respective `Multistream Target`.
  - An `Online` status indicates that the `Multistream Target` is successfully
    connected.
  - An `Offline` status means that we've received an error when trying to
    connect to the target. To try again, check the ingest URL and stream key of
    your destination service, re-configure your `Multistream Target` and restart
    your stream.

  ## Logs

  Logs will surface informational alerts (ex. multistream destinations are
  connected/disconnected) or any fatal errors from the transcoding process. Here
  is an example of a fatal error:

  ```bash
  Transcode error from mdw-staging-livepeer-orchestrator-0 for segment 0: **Unsupported input pixel format**
  ```

If you run into this or any similarly formatted errors, check the configuration
in your streaming software (e.g. OBS) and restart the stream.

## Session Ingest Rate

Session ingest rate tells you the bitrate of the video received by Livepeer
ingest servers, updated every 10 seconds. A high bitrate is suggestive that
streams into the Livepeer system are high quality, your encoder is working
properly, and your internet connection is good. A fluctuating or low bitrate may
suggest that your encoder is configured improperly or that the streamer internet
connection isn't as strong as it should be to deliver high quality streams to
your viewers.
