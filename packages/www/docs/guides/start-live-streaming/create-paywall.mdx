# Creating Paywall for Your Live Streams

Building paywall is a common approach form monetizing live video content. While
Livepeer Studio does not have a built-in paywall feature, it integrates well
with other tools and platforms.

Example solutions include:

1. [JWPlayer](https://www.jwplayer.com/) allows you to create a password for
   each video asset, or to lock down access to public video altogether via URL
   token signing. Refer to the
   [JWPlayer demo](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-jwplayer-demo) for an
   example integration between JWPlayer and Livepeer Studio.
2. For WordPress sites, there is a
   [rich plugin ecosystem](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/paywall/) that
   provide many different paywall options.
3. You can use application logic to hide the unique Livepeer Studio video
   playback URL behind a custom paywall by default.
