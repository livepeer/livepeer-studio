# Get an API key

You need an API key to make requests of the Livepeer.com API. You do not need to
create an API key if you are creating and configuring live streams using only
the Livepeer.com Dashboard.

Login to the Livepeer.com Dashboard, and navigate to the API keys page within
the Developers tab
[livepeer.com/dashboard/developers/api-keys](https://livepeer.com/dashboard/developers/api-keys).
On this page, you can manage your API keys including creating or deleting them
and monitoring their usage.

When you create a new API key, copy and secure the value displayed to you. This
is the sole secret you will have to use when making requests to the Livepeer.com
API, so share and store it with caution. We currently allow you to reveal the
secret of any existing API key but this behavior may change in the future, so
make sure to persist the API key safely. If you ever forget an API key you'll
always be able to delete it and create a new one anyway.

To use an API key, simply add an `Authorization` header to your request with the
`Bearer` scheme and the API key as the value. Example:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_key}'
  https://livepeer.com/api/user/me
```

## CORS

By default, API keys can only be used from a backend server. This is to ensure
maximum security and prevent that you accidentally expose your account by
including the secret API key in some public web page.

However, if you are developing a frontend application and want to get started
quickly with the Livepeer API, you can also create an API key with CORS access
enabled. API keys created with that option can be used from the browser, from
any origin that you configure it for.

    Note: An origin is just a combination of a scheme, like
    <code>https</code>, with a domain like <code>example.com</code>. You will also
    need to include the port number if you are using a non-standard port. <br />
    e.g.: <code>http://localhost:8080</code> when developing locally on port
    8080 or <code>https://my.app.io</code> after deploying it on a public
    domain.

To do so, simply tick the `Allow CORS access` checkbox when creating your API
key. You will then be prompted to add all the origins that you would like the
API key to be used from:

We recommend that you add the minimal list of origins to your API key. Ideally
also creating separate API keys to be used for development or production. At
your own discretion, you can add all the origins you will need on the same API
key and use it from all your environments, or even just add the `*` special
origin to allow the key to be used from any origin.
