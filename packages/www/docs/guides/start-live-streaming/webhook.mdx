# **Using Webhooks**

Livepeer Studio uses webhooks to communicate with your application
asynchronously when events for your stream occur. For example, you may want to
know when a stream has become active or idle, so that you can surface this
information to viewers. When these events happen, we’ll make a `POST` request to
a URL that you specify.

### How to configure endpoints

Webhook endpoints are specific for each `event`. Once the event is registered,
all streams for this account will be triggering the specific event. Here is an
example of registering for the `stream.started` and `stream.idle` events:

```bash
curl \
    -X POST \
    -H "authorization: Bearer {api_key}" \
    -H "content-type: application/json" \
    --data-raw '{
      "events": ["stream.started", "stream.idle"],
      "url": "{webhook_url}",
      "name": "test webhooks"
  }' \
  https://livepeer.studio/api/webhook
```

This request should return:

```json
{
  "createdAt": 1624939859628,
  "events": ["stream.started", "stream.idle"],
  "id": "e7b8a281-8952-4791-b837-183cb95bbf32",
  "kind": "webhook",
  "name": "test webhooks",
  "url": "{webhook_endpoint}",
  "userId": "ffcd3b74-9908-4d23-be05-58e1480e752a"
}
```

Now all streams will trigger the `stream.started` and `stream.idle` events for
this account.

### Other webhooks endpoints

`GET /api/webhook`: Get a list of webhooks

`GET /api/webhook/:webhookID`: Get a single webhook Object details

`PUT /api/webhook/:webhookID`: Edit a webhook, using the same parameters as POST
/webhook

`DEL /api/webhook/:webhookID`: Delete a webhook

### Types of Events

<Table
  data={[
    {
      name: "stream.started",

        "The parent stream object's isActive value is marked as true and the .m3u8 HLS URL works",
    },
    {
      name: "stream.idle",
      description:
        "The parent stream object's isActive value should be marked as false and the .m3u8 HLS URL no longer works",
    },
    {
      name: "recording.ready",
      description: "This fires when a recording is ready to be downloaded",
    },
    {
      name: "recording.started",
      description: "This fires when recording has started on an active stream",
    },
    {
      name: "recording.waiting",
      description:
        "This fires after a stream with recording on has concluded and is not yet ready to be downloaded. Typically it takes 5 minutes for recordings to be ready for download.",
    },
    {
      name: "multistream.connected",
      description:
        "This fires when we've successfully connected to the multistream target",
    },
    {
      name: "multistream.error",
      description:
        "This fires when we've encountered an error either while attempting to connect to the third party streaming service or while broadcasting.",
    },
    {
      name: "multistream.disconnected",
      description:
        "This fires when we are no longer sending video to the multistream target.",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Retries

Currently, if a webhook fails, Livepeer will attempt to deliver the webhook for
~15 minutes with an exponential back off.
