# Playback a live stream

This is how a Livepeer.com playback URL is formatted:
`https://livepeercdn.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8`.

All sessions for a stream have the same playback URL.

The easiest way to the stream a playback URL is to login to the Livepeer.com
Dashboard, navigate to the Streams page,
[livepeer.com/dashboard/streams](https://livepeer.com/dashboard/streams), and
click on a stream name. The playback URL is listed on the page.

You can also make a `GET` request to `https://livepeer.com/api/stream/{id}`, and
get the value of `playbackId` in the response. The playback URL can then be
formatted as above: `https://livepeercdn.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8`.

### Example code

#### cURL Method

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://livepeer.com/api/stream/{id}' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {api_key}'
```

#### Node.js with Axios Method

```javascript
const axios = require("axios");

axios
  .get("https://livepeer.com/api/stream/{id}", {
    headers: {
      Authorization: "Bearer {api_key}",
    },
  })
  .then((res) => {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(res.data));
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

## Video player

To build an application that plays a Livepeer livestream or VOD asset, you need
to use some sort of video player compatible with the HLS protocol. There are
many HLS video players out there, for example [video.js](https://videojs.com/)
or [JW Player](https://www.jwplayer.com/) which either have built-in support or
have plugins to support HLS.

### Embeddable Player

    Note: The embedded player is currently in <code>beta</code> and some
    elements may change as we mature the product. For a production-level
    application consider using your own player, like one of the suggested above.

</Alert>

To make getting started easier, you can also use the Livepeer embeddable player
in your page. To use it, you just need to create an `<iframe>` element in your
application with the URL pointing to the hosted player.

You only need to send it some information about what content it is supposed to
play, which is made via the `?v` query-string parameter, which should be set to
the `playbackId`. Notice that this playback ID can be either of a livestream or
a VOD asset and the player will figure out where to find the content to play.

#### Example Code

```html
<iframe
  src="https://lvpr.tv?v={playbackId}"
  frameborder="0"
  allowfullscreen
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  sandbox="allow-scripts">
</iframe>
```

## Stream delivery via CDN

Playback for all Pro plan streams is delivered via a content delivery network
(CDN). The transcoded video stream automatically switches between the transcoded
renditions based on the viewers' available bandwidth, device performance, and
network conditions.

Non-CDN delivery for free tier users is limited to 10 viewers per account.

## What if playback isn't working?

Look at the `lastSeen` and `isActive` (Status row on the Livepeer.com Dashboard)
values. If ingest was properly configured for playback, `lastSeen` will show the
current date and time and `isActive` will be `true` (Status row on the
Livepeer.com Dashboard will be Active).

If this isn't the case, confirm the `streamKey` and RTMP ingest URL,
`rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.com/live`, are configured correctly in your broadcast
software.

Lastly, check that your playback URL is correct.

## Audio-only streams

You can use `?video=false` at the end of an `.m3u8` URL to get an audio-only
stream. For example,
`https://livepeercdn.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8?video=false`.
