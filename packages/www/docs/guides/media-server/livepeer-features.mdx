# Livepeer Features

## Automated failover across many ingest points

Each instance of MistServer is aware of multiple ingest points in the Livepeer
network. This allows MistServer to quickly failover to another ingest point in
case the current ingest point becomes unstable or unavailable, without
interrupting the stream.

## Global ingest infrastructure

The Livepeer network has ingest points across North America, Europe, and Asia.
This means applications can use Mist and Livepeer to serve a global operation.

## Automated geo load balancing

Automated geo load balancing makes configuration very simple. Video will
automatically be transcoded at the closest location to the source.

## Sub real-time transcoding

The Livepeer infrastructure is quite powerful and aims to keep the latency as
low as possible, it is however currently limited in the sense that it needs to
build a buffer of a whole segment before it has something to transcode. The
transcode itself goes faster than real time, which helps in keeping the latency
low, but it will always be behind by the GOP size (keyframe interval) + network
latency.

Livepeer routes your live streams to the nearest available datacenter to ensure
your streamers and live stream viewers have a consistent, high quality
experience with the minimum latency Livepeer.com can provide. In the future we
will be moving to a fully streaming workflow removing this limitation and
lowering latency even further.
