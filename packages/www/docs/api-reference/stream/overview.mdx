# The `stream` object

The `stream` object is the core building block of the Livepeer.com API.

A Livepeer.com `stream` is a unique object with configuration data and metadata
about all live stream sessions associated with it.

The `stream` object parameters associated with configuration settings are
read-write, for example changing the `record` value to turn recording on or off
for future sessions.

Other `stream` object parameters are read only. These include the unique `id`,
ingested `sourceSegments` and duration data, among others.

    Note: historically, a <code>stream</code> object with a{" "}
    <code>parentId</code> represented a single live stream session. This type of
    "child-session" stream object will be deprecated in an upcoming version of
    the API in favor of the <code>session</code> object.
