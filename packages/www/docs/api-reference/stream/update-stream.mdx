# `PATCH` update a stream

`PATCH /stream/{id}` can be used to modify a `stream` object. It is a single
endpoint that can udpate any of the mutable properties of a stream.
Specifically:

- `record`
- `suspended`
- `multistream.targets`

For more information about them check `stream` object schema in
[Overview](/docs/api-reference/stream/overview).

All fields in the request payload are optional, and any field that is not
included will keep the same value as before in the saved object.

A `204 No Content` status response indicates the `stream` was successfully
updated.

        ]
