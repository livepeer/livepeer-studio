# `DELETE` a multistream target

`DELETE /multistream/target/{id}` deletes an existing `multistream target`
object. Make sure to remove any references to the target on existing `streams`
before actually deleting it from the API.

```bash
curl -X DELETE 'https://livepeer.studio/api/multistream/target/{id}' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}'
```
