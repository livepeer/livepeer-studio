# The `multistream target` object

The `multistream target` object is a single endpoint where a `stream` can be
multistreamed to. Multistreaming is the act of pushing the media from the given
stream while it is currently happening, also referred to as simulcast.

A `multistream target` object can be created pointing to a given URL (either
RTMP, RTMPS or SRT) and then referenced from a `stream` object in order for the
multistream to take place.

For more information about using them check the
[`Multistream`](/docs/guides/start-live-streaming/multistream) guide.

          endpoint without the need to update all streams that reference it or
          delete the multistream target object.
