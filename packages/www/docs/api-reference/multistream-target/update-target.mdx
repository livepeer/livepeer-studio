# `PATCH` update a multistream target

`PATCH /multistream/target/{id}` updates an existing `multistream target`
object. You can change any user-defined field in the current object,
specifically `name`, `url` and `disabled`. You cannot access the current `url`
field for updating it since we redact it from GET responses, so you have to
build the URL from scratch.

```bash
curl -X PATCH \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d '{
    "name": "Not My Original Multistream Target Anymore",
    "url": "rtmp://rtmp.real.service.com/SECRET"
    "disabled": true
}' \
'https://livepeer.com/api/multistream/target/{id}'
```
