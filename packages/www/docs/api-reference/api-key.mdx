# API key

You need an API key to make requests of the Livepeer Studio API. You do not need
to create an API key if you are creating and configuring live streams using only
the Livepeer Studio Dashboard.

For information on how to get an API key visit the
[`Get an API key`](/docs/guides/start-live-streaming/api-key) guide.

## Usage

To use an API key, simply add an `Authorization` header to your request with the
`Bearer` scheme and the API key as the value. Example:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_key}'
  https://livepeer.studio/api/user/me
```
