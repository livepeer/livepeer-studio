# The `session` object

The `session` object is a single live streaming session. It is an especially
important Livepeer Studio API object if need to reference recorded live stream
sessions.

All `session` objects have a `stream` object parent. The session's `parentId` is
the same string as its parent stream's `id`.

All `session` objects are read-only. Many `session` parameter values are
inherited directly from its `stream` parent, for example `profiles`, `record`,
`streamKey` and `playbackId` (all sessions with the same `parentId` use the same
`streamKey` and have the same .m3u8 playback URL).

Other `session` parameter values are unique to it, for example `id`, ingested
`sourceSegments`, duration data, and `recordingUrl` among others.
