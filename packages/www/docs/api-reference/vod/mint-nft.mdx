# How do I use Livepeer to mint a video NFT?

You can use
[this script](https://gist.github.com/victorges/3369cc04c0002a63b2fab33079d8827e)
(`bash`) to have a local file uploaded to Livepeer and then export it to IPFS.

Livepeer also exports some default metadata for an ERC-1155 token pointing to
your video file. That metadata is entirely customizable, so you can either
override or delete any fields that we set automatically. You can also not use
the metadata generated by Livepeer and just upload your own file to IPFS,
pointing to the same CID hash of the video. Both the video and metadata CIDs are
returned separately for your own convenience.

Notice that even though the metadata output field from the export is called
`erc1155Metadata`, it could be used for minting both ERC-1155 or regular ERC-721
fields. You might just want to set the metadata fields appropriately for
compatibility with the latter. Check the [Custom Metadata](#custom-metadata)
section for more details.

## Example Usage

Start by getting a Livepeer API key to use from the script:
[Get an API key](https://livepeer.com/docs/guides/start-live-streaming/api-key)

Then set that API key on your terminal on the environment variable required by
the script:

```bash
export LP_API_TOKEN=<api key copied from the dashboard>
```

### Simple Upload

```bash
$ ./livepeer-nft.sh nasa25.mp4
1. Requesting upload URL... Pending asset with ID 482e73fe-7a27-419c-8f8e-46c19e5dcb9c!
2. Uploading file...
Waiting for asset to be ready.....
3. Starting export... Created export task with ID 8d53f215-e13b-4b2a-b8dc-a6fb7455e85e!
Waiting for export task completion...
4. Export successful! Result:
{
  "videoFileCid": "QmcEZYeH2QxySWqHFcQbSovb43NGST4JaDBpeG1Tk4aXmA",
  "erc1155MetadataCid": "QmTju7Q4iPbosYJfFvSdxcRkT4KPYCpem31Z6mGL979Kkg",
  "videoFileUrl": "https://ipfs.livepeer.com/ipfs/QmcEZYeH2QxySWqHFcQbSovb43NGST4JaDBpeG1Tk4aXmA",
  "erc1155MetadataUrl": "https://ipfs.livepeer.com/ipfs/QmTju7Q4iPbosYJfFvSdxcRkT4KPYCpem31Z6mGL979Kkg"
}
```

The ERC-155 metadata on that case looks like
[this](https://ipfs.livepeer.com/ipfs/QmTju7Q4iPbosYJfFvSdxcRkT4KPYCpem31Z6mGL979Kkg):

```json
{
  "name": "an awesome nft",
  "description": "Livepeer video from asset \"an awesome nft\"",
  "animation_url": "ipfs://QmcEZYeH2QxySWqHFcQbSovb43NGST4JaDBpeG1Tk4aXmA",
  "image": "ipfs://bafkreidmlgpjoxgvefhid2xjyqjnpmjjmq47yyrcm6ifvoovclty7sm4wm",
  "properties": {
    "video": "ipfs://QmcEZYeH2QxySWqHFcQbSovb43NGST4JaDBpeG1Tk4aXmA"
  }
}
```

### Custom Metadata

```bash
$ ./livepeer-nft.sh dj-spooky.mp4 "A Musical Masterpiece" '{"animation_url":null,"image":
"ipfs://bafkreiheds3nc3zrvkh4rxocmwohhs3obaqer6ptonxxbjcmpqwyom2kba","properties":{"artist":"DJ Spooky"},"attributes":[{"trait_
type":"style","value":"postmodernist"}]}'
Using metadata for NFT:
{

  },
  "attributes": [

    }

4. Export successful! Result:
{
  "videoFileCid": "Qmcc3SJgqVRcr69ZfBfpcvhg1HwUQss3VwcZ2KRYxw5m8j",
  "erc1155MetadataCid": "QmQbA3pMbgxJgRgjFM8geX9LfKvaoWrkDTaHcbqdZADHrD",
  "videoFileUrl": "https://ipfs.livepeer.com/ipfs/Qmcc3SJgqVRcr69ZfBfpcvhg1HwUQss3VwcZ2KRYxw5m8j",
  "erc1155MetadataUrl": "https://ipfs.livepeer.com/ipfs/QmQbA3pMbgxJgRgjFM8geX9LfKvaoWrkDTaHcbqdZADHrD"
}
```

The ERC-1155 metadata on that case looks like
[this](https://ipfs.livepeer.com/ipfs/QmQbA3pMbgxJgRgjFM8geX9LfKvaoWrkDTaHcbqdZADHrD):

```json
{
  "name": "A Musical Masterpiece",
  "description": "Livepeer video from asset \"A Musical Masterpiece\"",
  "image": "ipfs://bafkreiheds3nc3zrvkh4rxocmwohhs3obaqer6ptonxxbjcmpqwyom2kba",
  "properties": {
    "artist": "DJ Spooky",
    "video": "ipfs://Qmcc3SJgqVRcr69ZfBfpcvhg1HwUQss3VwcZ2KRYxw5m8j"
  },
  "attributes": [
    {
      "trait_type": "style",
      "value": "postmodernist"
    }
  ]
}
```

Notice that:

- The name was set to the same name of the asset, which is provided as the
  second argument to the `[livepeer-nft.sh](http://livepeer-nft.sh)` script. The
  default description also contains that name.
- The third argument to the script provides a JSON which overrides any fields on
  the default metadata. It can also reference a file with the desired metadata
  instead. e.g.:
  `./livepeer-nft.sh dj-spooky.mp4 "A Musical Masterpiece" metadata.json`
- The `image` field was overridden to another image. It is present on both the
  default and override metadata, but the override takes precedence. The `name`
  and `description` fields can also be overridden.
- The `animation_url` field was removed because it was set to `null` on the
  metadata override. That’s how you can remove a field.

## Minting the NFT

Now with both the video and the metadata CID, you can either:

- Mint an NFT directly with the `erc1155MetadataCid` exported by Livepeer;
- Or create any custom metadata you’d like pointing to the same `videoFileCid`,
  upload that on any IPFS pinning service like [nft.storage](http://nft.storage)
  and mint an NFT with that!

The CID hash is to be used as an IPFS URL like `ipfs://{cid}`, to be set as the
`data` field when minting an NFT. It will avoid storing a lot of data in the
blockchain, keeping only a reference to an immutable object stored off-chain in
the IPFS network.

For more information read the documentation on
[Minting an NFT with IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/mint-nfts-with-ipfs/).
