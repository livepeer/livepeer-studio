# Using VOD in the API

Livepeer supports different ways to import videos as Assets.

An `Asset` refers to a piece of media content that is stored in the Livepeer
platform.

The media content of an `Asset` cannot be updated once created, however it can
be used to create other assets, and can be modified within that process through
one or more tasks.

Livepeer currently support exports to IPFS, in order to let you mint video NFTs,
adding customizable metadata.
