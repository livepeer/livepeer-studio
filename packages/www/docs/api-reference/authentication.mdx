# Authentication

The Livepeer Studio API uses API keys to authenticate most requests, including
all requests associated with creating and retrieving a stream or session object.

The Livepeer Studio API uses Bearer authentication. You or the client must send
an API key in the Authorization header when making requests to protected
information:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <api-key>
```

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. API requests without proper
authentication will fail.
