## Local go-livepeer

If you want to test everything end-to-end locally including go-livepeer video
streaming, you can run `yarn run go-livepeer` to boot up a broadcaster and
orchestrator that the development API server knows about.

## Testing

To run the unit tests in development, you can run `npm run test:local`. The full
`npm run test` suite runs against every store and amalgamates the runs to ensure
full test coverage.
